# Todo-directory's Readme

Kanbany tickets as part of the repo!

This section of the repo gets to be quite unstructured, so, sling some of your thoughts in here, make a PR against it, and get some feedback from the community!


## Dear Community:

- **Have expertise, but no time?** Please make a text-only PR against the markdown TODOs to help the next person get their bearings on a ticket.

- **Have bandwidth?** Feel free to grab a "ticket" and make a PR.

- **Have an idea?** Feel free to add a "ticket" and a PR on it, and the community can weigh in.
